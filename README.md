# Car-Segmentor-using-transfer-learning

**Description:**

The "Car Segmentor using Transfer Learning" project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to tackle the challenge of accurately segmenting cars within images. At the heart of this endeavor is the application of transfer learning, a powerful methodology that enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge from a pre-trained model.

The project utilizes VGG16, a state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), as the encoder for a UNet architecture. The incorporation of VGG16 as the encoder enhances the model's ability to generalize and extract meaningful features from images. This is particularly crucial when working with a dataset that is highly specific, presenting a unique challenge for the model's adaptability.

In essence, the UNet architecture, enhanced by the transfer learning capabilities of VGG16, acts as a sophisticated car segmentor. The model is trained to precisely delineate the boundaries of cars within images, offering a robust solution for tasks such as object detection and image understanding in the automotive domain.

**Key Features:**
